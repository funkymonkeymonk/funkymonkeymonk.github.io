## About

For many, change can be scary. It makes things different, and different can be
better or worse. Where there is uncertainty, people can feel at risk. I like to
make change less scary, by making change less risky.

When we create good data gathering techniques, we can predict how change will
affect us. We choose to practice agile process to make sure the things that
matter most stay the same. We embrace small change often; then, using the data
we have gathered, we ask ourselves are we better today than we were yesterday?
We empower ourselves and each other. In doing so we know that while tomorrow
might not be as good as today, every day is making us better than we have ever
been.

I'm Will Weaver, I'm an agent of change.
